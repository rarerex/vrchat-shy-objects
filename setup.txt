--QUICK SETUP--

Place the Look Detector in the scene.
Place a prefab in the scene.
Drag the receiver in the prefab into the list of receivers in the look detector.

--PREFAB TYPES--

Shy Active
When looking away the object changes its active status.

Shy Colour
When looking away the object changes its colour.

Shy Once
Has the sane logic as Shy Colour but has a reset button to
show an example of resetting the "Once" flag every prefab has.

Shy Stalker
Moves closer to the players back when turned away from and stops when at distance threshold.

--HOW IT WORKS--

The look detector fires an event called "OnLookAway" to the first 
udon graph or udon sharp script on the receiver.

If the graph or script has a custom event called "OnLookAway" then it fires it.
You can then build your custom logic off of the event.


The look detector does not fire until initially looked at the receiver.
The look detector only listens for objects (receivers) in the receivers list.
